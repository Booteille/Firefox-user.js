# atomGit user.js for Firefox and its derivatives

=== IMPORTANT ===

this user.js is a suppliment that is intended to be appended to the ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js user.js file (https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/blob/master/user.js) which is a security and privacy centric user.js file for Firefox and its derivatives

you should probably read the relevent section(s) of the 'Firefox Configuration Guide for Privacy Freaks and Performance Buffs' (http://12bytes.org/articles/tech/firefoxgecko-configuration-guide-for-privacy-and-performance-buffs) before incorporating this user.js file which depends heavily upon the properly configured uBlock Origin (https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and uMatrix (https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix) browser extensions or, at the very least, back-up your entire Firefox profile before importing this user.js

the preferences in this user.js are my personal preferences - if you wish to modify anything, you might want to follow the advise contained in this file in order to make updating your user.js easier
