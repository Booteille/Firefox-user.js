# atomGit user.js for Firefox and its derivatives

## === IMPORTANT ===

**this user.js is a suppliment that is intended to be appended to the [ghacksuserjs user.js file](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js)** which is a security and privacy centric user.js file for Firefox and its derivatives

you should probably read the relevent section(s) of the ['Firefox Configuration Guide for Privacy Freaks and Performance Buffs'](http://12bytes.org/articles/tech/firefoxgecko-configuration-guide-for-privacy-and-performance-buffs) before incorporating this user.js file, which depends heavily upon the properly configured [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and [uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix) browser extensions or, at the very least, you should probably back-up your entire Firefox profile before importing the settings in this user.js

these preferences are my personal preferences - if you wish to modify anything, you might want to follow the advise contained in this user.js file in order to make updating your user.js easier
